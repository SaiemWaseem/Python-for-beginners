# Example Number 1 Classes
# A class is a blueprint for creating objects with specific attributes and methods. It is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) and allows you to create custom data types to model real-world entities or abstract concepts

# Example Number 5 Inheritance:
# Inheritance is an essential concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) and is supported by Python. It allows you to create a new class that inherits the properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) of an existing class, known as the base class or parent class. The new class is called the derived class or subclass. Inheritance promotes code reuse and enables you to create more specialized classes based on existing ones.

class Saiem(Waseem):
    def study(self):
        print("I'm studying day and night and become python developer and data scientist ‚úî‚ú® ")
class Jessica(Waseem):
    def Art(self):
        print("I can take admission in the Architect üòâ")
class Mehak(Waseem):
    def Engineer(self):
        print("I complete my degree nearerüòÅ")
class Saneha(Waseem):
    def computer(self):

#
# # multi-level-inheritance:
# Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance in object-oriented programming where a class derives from another class, which itself is derived from yet another class. This creates a chain of inheritance, where each class acts as both a subclass (derived class) and a base class (parent class) simultaneously.
